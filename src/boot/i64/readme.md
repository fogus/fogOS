# Pure64 -- The BareMetal OS kernel loader #
Copyright (C) 2007-2013 Return Infinity -- see LICENSE.TXT

Pure64 is a 64-bit software loader for BareMetal OS. The loader gets the computer into a full 64-bit state with no legacy compatibility layers and also enables all available CPU Cores in the computer. Pure64 keeps an information table in memory that stores important details about the computer (Amount of RAM and memory layout, number of CPU cores and their APIC IDs, etc). The Pure64 loader has been released separately so others can use it in their own software projects.

## Building

The Pure64 second stage ("PURE64.SYS") can be built directly using nasm:

    nasm pure64.asm -o pure64.sys


## Notes

Pure64 requires at least nasm v2; the version included in the OS X 10.7 Developer Tools is not recent enough.
