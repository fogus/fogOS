MAKING A BOOTABLE FLOPPY DISK WITH THE GRUB BOOTLOADER ON IT
================================================================
GRUB is a GPLed bootloader.

Home page:      http://www.gnu.org/software/grub
Binaries:       ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/grub/grub-0.90-i386-pc.tar.gz
Source code:    ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/grub/grub-0.90.tar.gz
HOW-TOs:        http://www.washingdishes.freeuk.com/grubtut.html

1. You will need
   - Two 1.44 meg floppy disks, one of them formatted with a
     filesystem that GRUB recognizes (e.g. FAT12 or ext2).
     The other floppy (the "unformatted" floppy) may contain
     a filesystem, but it will be destroyed.
   - The GRUB binaries: files "stage1" and "stage2". These are
     in the OSD distribution, in the directory "boot/grub".
   - A "menu.lst" configuration file for GRUB. Again, this
     is provided with OSD in the "boot/grub" directory.

2. On the formatted floppy disk, create the subdirectory
   "/boot/grub/", and copy the files "stage1", "stage2", and
   "menu.lst" into this subdirectory.

3. Concatenate the binary files "stage1" and "stage2" into a
   single binary file named "boot":
	(DOS/Windows):  copy /b stage1 + stage2 boot
	(Linux):        cat stage1 stage2 >boot

4. Write the file "boot" directly to the unformatted floppy.
   This is a sector-level write that does not use (and will
   destroy) any filesystem present on the disk:
	(DOS/Windows):  partcopy boot 0 168000 -f0
	(Linux):        cat boot >/dev/fd0

   PARTCOPY will display an error message because "boot" is
   much shorter than 0x168000 bytes, but this is OK.

5. Boot your PC from the unformatted floppy disk.

6. After GRUB has started, eject the unformatted floppy and
   insert the formatted floppy, containing the "stage1",
   "stage2", and "menu.lst" files, all in the "/boot/grub/"
   subdirectory. Type:
	setup (fd0)

7. The formatted floppy is now bootable. Do not move, modify,
   or delete the file "/boot/grub/stage2" on this floppy.
